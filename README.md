<!-- UTILIZATION -->
## Utilized Technology

1. In our project, the use of HTML provides the foundation of the web page structures. JS, within React components, adds dynamic functionality, surpassing other similar technologies in responsiveness. Instead of CSS, we utilized Material-UI (MUI) which has significantly improved the app's user interface and design. MUI's pre-built components and theming capabilities enable the team for the rapid development of a visually appealing and consistent user experience.
2. React and Redux play critical roles in enhancing the application's front-end development and state management. React's component-based architecture enables modular and reusable UI elements, resulting in improved maintainability and scalability. The most noticeable usage of React components would be in our Profile Form, where we reuse multiple Input components developed by one of the team member. With Redux, we efficiently manage the application's state, providing a centralized data store and allow our generated schedules to seamlessly flow across multiple components without refetching from our database.
3. Express plays a pivotal role as the backend framework, enabling the implementation of multiple API functionalities such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Each API efficiently returns the result of its respective operation or throws the appropriate error if the operation is unsuccessful, ensuring smooth communication between the front-end and back-end through the use of Redux thunks. Moreover, we prioritize security by introducing user authentication via JWT tokens, safeguarding sensitive data with an added layer of protection.
4. MongoDB serves as our primary database, offering a flexible and scalable solution for storing and managing user data and generated schedules. Its NoSQL nature allows us to store complex data structures with ease, improving data retrieval performance and enhancing the app's overall efficiency. To improve security, we separated user login verification and the rest of the user data. The combination of JWT Token and model design ensures a secure and reliable access to sensitive information.
5. Our current application is deployed on Render. Render's seamless integration with GitHub enables automatic builds and deployments, ensuring continuous deployment and reducing manual intervention. Its user-friendly interface and scalability provide a reliable and efficient platform for hosting our production-level web application.

<!-- WHATS NEXT -->
## What's Next

In our next steps to further improve the app, we plan to dynamically update fitness plans based on users' logged history, incorporating user reviews and feedback to provide personalized and evolving workout routines. Additionally, we aim to implement a Computer Vision feature that analyzes users' posture, offering real-time feedback to ensure proper form during exercises. Furthermore, we plan to introduce live audio feedback during workouts, creating an immersive and interactive fitness experience for our users. These additions will enhance the app's usability and help users achieve their fitness goals more effectively.
